# Billing (Cash and Insurance) Module

This module facilitates efficient patient bill settlement for the totality of services provided, comprehensively accounting for both cash and insurance-covered invoices. The module adopts a reverse chronological arrangement, prioritizing the most recent bill for immediate attention. Users are empowered to print all patient invoices at their discretion and are further equipped to initiate requests for loans, discounts, or exemptions through the dedicated social welfare module, subject to administrator approval.
