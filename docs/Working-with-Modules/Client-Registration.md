# Client Registration Module

The **Client Registration Module** provides a comprehensive suite of patient care services, including registration for cash-paying, insured, emergency, and referral patients. It enables users to collect essential biographical information in fields aligned with the Measure Evaluation (2015) and eGa (2016) Routine Health Information System (RHIS) Data Management Standards. 

The system automatically generates a unique Medical Record Number (MRN) and allows users to specify multiple patient IDs, ensuring system-wide uniqueness. Preferred or default identifiers can be provided as needed. The system also offers a variety of search criteria and generates immediate alerts for duplicate data, inaccurate entries, or discrepancies, guiding users to the next step in the hospital's workflow, such as outpatient clinic or triage procedures.
