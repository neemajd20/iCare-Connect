# Working With Modules

## Client Registration Module

The Client Registration Module provides a comprehensive suite of patient care services, including registration for cash-paying, insured, emergency, and referral patients. It enables users to collect essential biographical information in fields aligned with the Measure Evaluation (2015) and eGa (2016) Routine Health Information System (RHIS) Data Management Standards. The system automatically generates a unique Medical Record Number (MRN) and allows users to specify multiple patient IDs, ensuring system-wide uniqueness. Preferred or default identifiers can be provided as needed. The system also offers a variety of search criteria and generates immediate alerts for duplicate data, inaccurate entries, or discrepancies, guiding users to the next step in the hospital's workflow, such as outpatient clinic or triage procedures.

The registration form gathers key patient data like name, age, date of birth, gender, and contact details. This information is conveniently accessible in both OPD and IPD register reports, generated automatically for your reference. Figure 8 shows the view of the registration form for the user to follow.

## Registering a New Client

To register a new patient, the following are the steps to be followed:

1. Click on the registration module.
2. Then, click on the search button and enter the name of the patient if it exists in the system; this is done to prevent registering a single client more than once.
3. If it does not exist, click on the **Register New Patient** button.

After completing the registration, now you will be able to:

1. See the patient’s visit read as ‘**Current Visit**’ (1).
2. Classify the visit as an **‘Emergency Visit’** (2) or a **‘Referral Visit’** (3).
3. If it is neither of the two above, then the visit should be classified with regards to the visit type, which can either be:
   - **OPD** (4)
   - **Health Programs** (5)
   - **Specialized Clinics** (6)
   - **Diagnostic Service** (7)
   - Or any other as specified.

You will then be required to select the payment option the client is going to use as either:

1. **Cash** by clicking the **Cash** button (1), or
2. If the patient is using an insurance service, then click the **Insurance** button (2), from which you will choose the insurance used by the patient.

After completion, you can now start the visit by clicking the **Start Visit** button (3).

### Follow-Up Visit Clients

If this is not the client’s first visit, then upon searching the client’s name, his/her details will appear, thus allowing starting a new visit.

- On searching (1) for the client named ‘August’, the result of the search has brought her details (2).

    #### Updating Patient’s Authorization

This is …………………………………  



   #### Updating/Changing Consultation Room

This can only be done to clients with active visits.  
Whereas it can be in two cases:

#### Changing Consultation Room for a Single Client

This is a case when there is a need to move a specified client from one consultation room to another.  
To do so:

1. Search for the name of the client, **‘4.1.1.B’**.
2. Click on the specific client’s name, **‘4.1.1.B’**.
3. On the option box, select **‘Update Consultation Room’** (1).

4. Select the new consultation room (2) from the options available.
5. Click **‘Update’** (3) to save changes.



#### Updating Consultation Room for Clients in a Specific Room

This is a case when there is a need to move clients from one consultation room to another.  
To achieve this:

1. Go to the **‘Registration’** home page and select the consultation room clients are to be moved from.
![alt text](<../../static/img/Display of active patient1.PNG>)
This will display all active patients in that room.  
![alt text](<../../static/img/Display of active patient2.PNG>)
Now you can move each one of them to another consultation room, as in **‘4.1.3.A’**.
