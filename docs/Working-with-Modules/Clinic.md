# Clinic Module

The Clinic Module offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to streamline the management of patient consultations within the hospital setting. It encompasses various functionalities, including consultation notes, orders for laboratory tests, procedures, radiology examinations, prescriptions, and diagnoses. This module facilitates seamless interactions between clinicians and patients across different categories, including new patients, revisiting patients, and those with scheduled appointments.

The module maintains detailed visit records for each patient, systematically organized in chronological order. Users can easily manage patient consultations and track their progress throughout the visit.  
This comprehensive view allows for efficient patient management and prioritization of care. This allows clinicians to make well-informed decisions based on complete patient history.

Doctors can efficiently transfer patients within the hospital or refer them to external medical facilities using printed referral forms generated by the system.  

Therefore, all information entered into the system by a doctor generates an electronic patient register for the outpatient department as seen in **Figure 9**.  

- Shows all rooms present in the facility.  
- Shows the different statuses one can select from to view patients.
