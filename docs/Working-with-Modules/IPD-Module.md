# IPD Module

This module manages all aspects of a hospital ward, including:  
1. General patient observation, nurse care planning and treatment, and overall ward management.  
2. Bed assignment, patient transfers, and real-time bed occupancy monitoring. Additionally, it automates the invoicing process based on a patient's length of stay and bed fees.

The module also empowers healthcare staff to streamline patient admissions, transfers, and discharges within the ward or bed units. Figure 11 elaborates on the activities.
