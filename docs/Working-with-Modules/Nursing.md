# Nursing Module

This comprehensive module includes a wide range of services, such as collecting and closely monitoring patients' vital signs, developing and implementing care plans by dedicated nursing professionals, and managing various critical aspects of ward operations, such as bed assignments, patient transfers, and real-time bed occupancy monitoring as captured in Figure 10. It also automates the bill generation process based on the length of a patient's stay and the corresponding bed fees.

This module also provides a solution for the admission, transfer, and discharge of patients from the wards or beds. It empowers nursing staff to efficiently allocate beds to patients, order necessary investigations, oversee medication administration, keep observations up to date, maintain ward occupancy records, and handle day-to-day administrative tasks with ease. Additionally, it offers the capability to access comprehensive discharge summaries for patients.

Moreover, under the triage nursing module, users can prioritize patients in the queue based on their urgency and unique needs, even though the system follows a chronological sequence with date and time stamps (manually specified). A nurse or medical practitioner can use this module to conduct an initial examination and meticulously document a patient's vital signs. A nurse module provides a wide variety of services, including triage, observation, bed rest, injection, and dressing services.
