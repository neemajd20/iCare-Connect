# System Benefits

The iCare system provides a comprehensive view of the patient as it helps track the care over the personâ€™s lifetime. It provides effective care coordination through streamlined workflows and information sharing, and in so doing, iCare helps to improve productivity and efficiency while cutting down on paperwork. Integrated patient tracking allows billing and insurance claims to be filled on time. iCare provides greater efficiency and cost savings; it significantly cuts administrative expenses, including reducing the need for transcriptions, physical chart storage, coding, and claims management, as well as facilitating care coordination and reducing the time it takes for hard-copy communications among clinicians, labs, and pharmacies.  

Other benefits include:  
- User-friendly user interface (UI) system.  
- Enabling quick and secure access to medical records since the system is hosted and accessed on the hospital's local network only.  
- Supports efficient and effective patient journey execution (from admission, consultation, diagnosis, lab testing, and hospital discharge).  
- Supporting billing for all hospital services provided to the hospital.  
- It supports the exemption and loan mechanism for patients with financial challenges.  
- Securely exchanging electronic information with a verification system such as the National Health Information Fund (NHIF).
