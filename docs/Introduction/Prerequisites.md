# Prerequisites

Users should have a basic understanding of using a computer, keyboard, and mouse. In addition, being able to understand the basic functions of a web browser will be beneficial, as will elements such as pop-up windows. In some cases, more than one web page may be open; the user should know how to use and navigate to a different tab when required. Many of the terms and functions, however, are common across the software, including buttons such as ‘Add’, ‘Save’, ‘Update’, ‘Edit’, ‘Delete’, and ‘Show’.
