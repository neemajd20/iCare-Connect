# System Overview

iCareConnec+ is a web-based Electronic Medical Record application platform mainly for hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries that want to run their medical services and processes electronically. The iCareConnec+ system manages medical records digitally for quick access and better medical care services. iCareConnec+ has a robust built-in API and can be integrated with other hospital systems to support information exchange and interoperability within existing hospital systems. The iCare system is interoperable with DHIS2 to ensure the availability of HMIS data from all health facilities for easy data sharing, analysis, visualization, and use. The iCareConnec+ System enables the entire patient journey, from patient registration, billing, consultation, lab testing, and medication, to patient engagement.
